### MalwareDB
Inspired by [VXCage](https://github.com/botherder/vxcage) and [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/), MalwareDB is a malware knowledge management system which handles the bookkeeping regarding malware/goodware samples: hashes, origination, similarity, file types, and more. Its intention is to help malware/cybersecurity researchers, forensic investigators, and others who have a need to handle malware, or other files of potentially unknown origin. This is very much a **work in progress** and **alpha-quality** project at present.

#### Key Features:
* Store malware, goodware, or unknown file samples
* Categorize samples
  * Tags
  * Origin
* Permissions by group, access to file based on users' group membership
* Fetch samples
* Search based on file similarity (requires the Postgres plugins mentioned below)
* Works on any modern operating system

#### Requirements:
* [Postgres](http://postgresql.org/) database server
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) to compile
* Similarity hash extensions for Postgres:
  * [LZJD](https://github.com/malwaredb/LZJD)
  * [SSDeep](https://github.com/malwaredb/ssdeep_psql)
  * [SDHash](https://github.com/malwaredb/sdhash_psql)
  * [TLSH](https://github.com/malwaredb/tlsh_pg)
* Alternatively, use [docker](https://github.com/malwaredb/docker)

#### Status
This project is in active development and not yet stable, nor are all the features implemented.

#### Future
* Planned features:
  * Web interface as a separate application
  * GUI applications
  * Support for [Confidential Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidential_computing)
    * Initially for Enarx: [Website](https://enarx.dev/), [Code](https://github.com/enarx/enarx)
* Potential features:
  * File storage backends for HDFS, S3, others?
