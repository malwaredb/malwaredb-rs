Re-write of MalwareDB from Go to Rust!

This is very much a work in progress, and will take some time.

To-Do:
* Re-write executable parsers, Go provided this, Rust does not.
* Decide on plugin style, potentially use WebAssembly.
* Have proper CI/CD.

Goals:
* Support `wasm32-wasi`
* Support `x86_64-fortanix-unknown-sgx`
