* Postgres and SQLite are able to create users, login (get API key), reset all API keys, change passwords.
* `mdb_server` may have admin capabilities if compiled with `--features=admin`. SQLite support is also gated behind a feature flag, `--features=sqlite`.
* Unit tests are focused on SQLite for ease, but also exist for Postgres. Run with `cargo test -- --ignored`. Requires a database with username, password, and db name: "malwaredbtesting" on localhost.
* All crates have `pub const MDB_VERSION: &str = env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION");` at the root level for future API use, to help ensure the client, server, and any future use can make sure the versions are the same before trying to make or interpret requests.

* Refactored the code to prepare for client/server development. The `api` sub-crate will hold the common data structures used for communication.
* There will be only one `types` crate for all supported data formats, instead of the original plan of sub-crate per class of formats.

* Trying to parse ELF imports is proving to be rather difficult!
* [Goblin](https://docs.rs/goblin/latest/goblin/) seems to be a well-supported and feature-rich crate, but I haven't figured out how to match the imported function to the library, so I [asked](https://github.com/m4b/goblin/issues/363).

* Initial commit.
