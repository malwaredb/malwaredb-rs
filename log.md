* Users can login, get the API key to the local MDB client config.
* Trait `HashPath` for easy creation of a relative path based on a SHA-256 hash.
* Moved LZJD, Murmur hashes from rjzak account to MalwareDB org.

* Get, display server stats.
* Finding global config for MDB server.
* Database pool for Postgres connection.
* Figured out how to return JSON with Axum.
* Figured out how to handle DB connections with Axum, but had to get rid of `DatabaseConnection` trait due to complexitied of having a trait with `async` functions, and that the [async-trait](https://crates.io/crates/async-trait) crate adds weirdness to data returned by the async functions.

# 11 April 2023
* Looking at using the `clap_complete` crate to generate shell autocompletion scripts. Didn't work when tested, but will investigate.

* Postgres and SQLite are able to create users, login (get API key), reset all API keys, change passwords.
* `mdb_server` may have admin capabilities if compiled with `--features=admin`. SQLite support is also gated behind a feature flag, `--features=sqlite`.
* Unit tests are focused on SQLite for ease, but also exist for Postgres. Run with `cargo test -- --ignored`. Requires a database with username, password, and db name: "malwaredbtesting" on localhost.
* All crates have `pub const MDB_VERSION: &str = env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION");` at the root level for future API use, to help ensure the client, server, and any future use can make sure the versions are the same before trying to make or interpret requests. 

# 18 March 2023
* Refactored the code to prepare for client/server development. The `api` sub-crate will hold the common data structures used for communication.
* There will be only one `types` crate for all supported data formats, instead of the original plan of sub-crate per class of formats.

# 16 March 2023
* Trying to parse ELF imports is proving to be rather difficult!
* [Goblin](https://docs.rs/goblin/latest/goblin/) seems to be a well-supported and feature-rich crate, but I haven't figured out how to match the imported function to the library, so I [asked](https://github.com/m4b/goblin/issues/363).

# 19 Feb 2023
* Initial commit.
